# Final Build Status

## Progress Update

We have successfully implemented the following fixes:

1. **Modified Build Script**: Updated package.json to include the cpy-cli command that copies the next-intl configuration files:
   ```json
   "build": "cpy 'i18n.ts' 'middleware.ts' 'next-intl.config.js' 'messages' '.next/' --parents && next build"
   ```

2. **Fixed Navigation Debugger**: Resolved the TypeError in components/NavigationDebugger.tsx where `debugInfo.buttons.map` was incorrectly called on an object instead of an array.

## Next Steps

Since we're experiencing technical issues with directly capturing the terminal output, please follow these steps to manually verify the build result:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory:
   `c:\Users\felix tremigual\.qoder\synarch-landing`

2. Run the build command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. Observe the output and determine if the build was successful or not

4. Based on the result, update this file with one of the following:

## If Build Succeeds
Replace the content of this file with:
```
ÉXITO: El build se completó correctamente.
```

## If Build Fails
Replace the content of this file with:
```
FALLO: El build falló de nuevo.
```

And paste the complete error log below that line.

## Expected Outcome

With our fixes, the build process should now:
1. First copy the next-intl configuration files (`i18n.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `next-intl.config.js`) and the `messages` directory to the `.next/` directory
2. Then execute the normal Next.js build process without errors related to missing next-intl configuration files

Please run the build command manually and update this file with the result to complete Mission 4.
