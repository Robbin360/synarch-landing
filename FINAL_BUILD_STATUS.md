# Final Build Status

## Instructions for Manual Verification

Since we're experiencing technical issues with directly capturing the terminal output, please follow these steps to manually verify the build result:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory:
   `c:\Users\felix tremigual\.qoder\synarch-landing`

2. Run the build command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. Observe the output and determine if the build was successful or not

4. Based on the result, update this file with one of the following:

## If Build Succeeds
Replace the content of this file with:
```
ÉXITO: El build se completó correctamente.
```

## If Build Fails
Replace the content of this file with:
```
FALLO: El build falló de nuevo.
```

And paste the complete error log below that line.

## What to Look For

The modified build script should:
1. First copy the next-intl configuration files (`i18n.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `next-intl.config.js`) and the `messages` directory to the `.next/` directory
2. Then execute the normal Next.js build process

If the build succeeds, it means our fix worked and the next-intl configuration files are now being properly included in the build process.

Please run the build command manually and update this file with the result to complete Mission 4.
