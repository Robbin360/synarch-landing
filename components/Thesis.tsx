            In an era of exponential technological advancement, the distinction between prediction and creation has blurred. 
            Traditional forecasting methods fail because they attempt to extrapolate from existing paradigms. 
            We operate differently. We identify the fundamental constraints that shape reality and systematically remove them.

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-white/90 mb-12">
            Our approach is not about predicting which technologies will succeed, but about creating the conditions 
            where certain outcomes become inevitable. We are not futuristsâ€”we are architects of the possible.
