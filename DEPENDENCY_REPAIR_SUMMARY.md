# Dependency Repair Summary

## Actions Taken

1. **Created Dependency Repair Script**: Created `fix-dependencies.js` to automate the cleanup and reinstallation of npm dependencies.

2. **Executed Dependency Repair Script**: Ran the script to remove `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file.

3. **Cleaned npm Cache**: Used `npm cache clean --force` to clear any corrupted cache data.

4. **Reinstalled Dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to reinstall all project dependencies.

5. **Started Development Server**: Launched the Next.js development server with `npm run dev`.

6. **Identified Internationalization Issue**: Discovered that the application was having issues with the next-intl configuration.

7. **Modified Configuration**: Made changes to address the next-intl configuration issues:
   - Updated `app/layout.tsx` to handle potential errors when loading messages
   - Created `next-intl.config.js` to provide explicit configuration for next-intl

## Current Status

- The development server is running on port 3003
- Dependencies have been successfully reinstalled
- There is still an issue with the next-intl configuration that needs to be resolved

## Next Steps

1. Further investigate the next-intl configuration issue
2. Verify that all internationalization features are working correctly
3. Test all application features to ensure they're functioning properly
